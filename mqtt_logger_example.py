# MQTT Logger Example
# This is an auxiliary program provided alongside main.py
# that subscribes to an MQTT Topic and prints each received message.
# If you want to study the example for publishing data please start in main.py.
#
# This MQTT logger example can be used to debug whether in an MQTT topic messages are arriving.
# It can be used as an alternative to the tool MQTT Explorer for example.
#
# To use this program please replace the configuration values below locally.


# ----- Configuration is hardcoded for now -----
